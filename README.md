# todo-puzzles
Progressive Web App (PWA) version of the To-Do Puzzles Application.

It's a brand new way to-do anything.

Introducing To-Do Puzzles where to-do list items are expanded into simple puzzles inspired by a mini-game from "Scooby-Doo! Unmasked" on the Game Boy Advance redesigned for a todo app.

Each puzzle you need to create will come with a customizable name, category, deadline, up to eight pieces for each task and a reward image. You can even upload any image from your device in place of the reward image for completing the puzzles for a more "rewarding" experience.

The performance of the app may vary depending on the types of images and number you choose to upload to the app. GIF images may slow down the app significantly.

Disclaimer: Any image you upload will only be saved to a local database for the specific puzzle you upload it for. Once you delete the puzzle, the image will also be deleted from the app.

I hope you enjoy what the app has to offer.

If you have any questions, feel free to send me an email at stevenaiannucci@gmail.com.

Any bugs or issues reported should be resolved in a timely manner but I should have already taken care of each part of the app to ensure that everything works as intended for the best possible experience.

You can even install the app once you're on the page. You should see the install icon next to the share icon in the address bar with the url. An Android version is also available to download under Releases.

Currently, on web platforms, the active puzzles are being treated differently from expired ones. It's best that, in the event of there being a bugged expired puzzle (puzzles that comes back despite being deleted or automatically reverts to being expired when made active when the app is opened after having been closed), users consider it a placeholder and leave it alone so they can continue using the app as intended. So long as you don't mess with the "placeholder", the states that you left your puzzles after closing the app should remain as is. I'm not sure what's causing the issue, but until it gets fixed, this is the best way to handle it.
